# 100 days of code challenge (SQL)

#### Day 1: November 15, 2022

##### **Today's Progress:** Today I began querying a London Bus Injury dataset where I set out to answer multiple questions that I came up with based on the data. 

##### **Thoughts:** It was really satisfying troubleshooting my failed queries, I relied on the StackOverflow community to help me figure out why I wasn't getting a decimal value for a percentage I was trying to calculate (was told to use 100.00 instead of 100). I'm proud that I was successful in my work and am excited to continue gathering insights tomorrow. 

##### **Skills Used:** 

  1. WHERE statements
  2. GROUP BY statements
  3. ORDER BY statements
  4. COUNT()
  5. DESC
  6. CAST() AS DECIMAL (10,2)
  7. VIEWS
  8. INNER JOIN statements
  9. VIEWS based on INNER JOINS
