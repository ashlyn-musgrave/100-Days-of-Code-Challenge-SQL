# 100 days of code challenge (SQL)

#### Day 1: November 15, 2022

##### **Today's Progress:** Today I began querying a London Bus Injury dataset where I set out to answer multiple questions that I came up with based on the data. 

##### **Thoughts:** It was really satisfying troubleshooting my failed queries, I relied on the StackOverflow community to help me figure out why I wasn't getting a decimal value for a percentage I was trying to calculate (was told to use 100.00 instead of 100). I'm proud that I was successful in my work and am excited to continue gathering insights tomorrow. 

##### **Skills Used:** 

  1. WHERE statements
  2. GROUP BY statements
  3. ORDER BY statements
  4. COUNT()
  5. DESC
  6. CAST() AS DECIMAL (10,2)
  7. VIEWS
  8. INNER JOIN statements
  9. VIEWS based on INNER JOINS
  10. LIKE '%'

#### Day 2: November 16, 2022

##### **Today's Progress:** Today I worked with the same London Bus Safety dataset and looked at the most dangerous/safest Boroughs in terms of Bus accidents. I also looked at the total number of victims per incident type. 

##### **Thoughts:** I felt a lot more confident querying this dataset today, I had a really long process in my head for how to do something and figured out a way to shorten it and create less work. I'm skill getting an error when trying to PIVOT my table but will keep trying until I get it. 

##### **Skills Used:**  

  1. OUTER JOIN
  2. UNION
  3. PIVOT
